SeiyuuBase is a site focused on Japanese voice actors and actresses (_声優_ _seiyuu_)

## Motivation

It starts as a random talk with my fellow _weeaboo_ friends about best voice actresses and where they're topped and I think "why not write an app for that?". And the discussion ends with I saying "Gonna create an _seiyuu_ app soon". Added by my urge to find other anime where both [Kana Hanazawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana_Hanazawa) and [Inori Minase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inori_Minase) starred after [A Place Further Than the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_Further_than_the_Universe) ended, thus SeiyuuBase born after 3 hours of fiddling with AniList's GraphQL API
